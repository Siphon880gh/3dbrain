Blender lets you merge your images into cubes and other geometries, but also lets you modify the pose of your characters. Then you export as fbx for unreal engine to import

You can also use Blender to convert (import then export) free 3d models into a format that unreal can import

You can add rigs so parts of your character model can be animated in Unreal Sequencerâ€™s FK Control Rig
