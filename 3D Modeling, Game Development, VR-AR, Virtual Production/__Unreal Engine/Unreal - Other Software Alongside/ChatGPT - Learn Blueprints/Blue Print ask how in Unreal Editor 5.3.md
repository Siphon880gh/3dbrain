Purpose: Ask AI how to perform a specific effect using Blue Print Event Graph nodes. It will provide a visual representation of the nodes.

### Status: Not entirely reliable answers...
Not entirely reliable answers from AI, and it will gaslight you saying it is correct. After it gives you the nodes, that's a good point to read the node documentation on Unreal, look up Google Images, and read forums via google search.

In Unreal editor 5.3, I add a sound. How to stop playing after 3 seconds with Blue Print nodes.

Show me mermaid flow code of these nodes. Please name the nodes the same as Blueprint's nodes.

For example:
```
flowchart TD
    A[Event BeginPlay] -->B[Delay]
```

Then copy the mermaid flow code to https://mermaid.live/
This will be what you try to imitate on Blue Print
