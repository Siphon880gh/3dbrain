Create the whites. (Shift+A → Mesh → Ico Sphere) Or you could create a cube then CTRL+4 for subidivision modifier level 4 (losing polygon count to the level the cube loses its edges and becomes a spehre)

Then resize and fit into the slots. You might want to mirror modifier along the Y or X axis.

Duplicate the white eye then resize into a vertical slit

Now you may want to make the whites actually white and the slit black by adding materials in the material section
