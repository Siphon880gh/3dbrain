In Blender, the seam tool is primarily used in the process of UV unwrapping, which is essential for texturing 3D models. When you mark a seam on a model, you're essentially defining the edges along which the model's surface will be "cut" open and laid out flat to create a two-dimensional UV map. This UV map then serves as a template onto which 2D textures can be painted or applied.

Remember that in UV, the "U" and "V" refer to the axis in the 2D texture space.

By marking seams, you help Blender understand how to unfold the 3D model into a 2D space with minimal stretching and distortion, making it easier to create accurate and detailed textures that wrap around the model correctly when it's rendered. Seams are strategically placed at the edges where the model's surface transitions or at natural boundaries within the model (like where different materials meet) to ensure the UV layout is as logical and efficient as possible.
