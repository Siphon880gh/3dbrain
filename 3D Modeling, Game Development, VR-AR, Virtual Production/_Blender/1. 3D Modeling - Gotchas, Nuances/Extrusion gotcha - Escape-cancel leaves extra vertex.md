During an extrusion, escape-cancel leaves extra vertex

When extruded from an edge or vertex, you can press Escape to cancel, however it still created a duplicate vertex (just you can't see it because there's a new vertex at the same coordinate as the old vertex). You can box select that area of where the vertex duplicate and vertex original are, then merge by distance (M â†’ merge by distance). Or after you press escape, you can undo (CMD+Z) to remove the extra vertex immediately (this obviously won't work if it had been a long time ago).
