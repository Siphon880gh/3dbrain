You've outlined a basic distinction between modeling and sculpting in 3D graphics and animation, but there's a bit more nuance to each process.

**Modeling** in 3D involves creating shapes and structures using a variety of techniques, including but not limited to boolean operations (adding or subtracting shapes that overlap each other), extrusion (extending shapes in a direction), and transformations (moving, scaling, rotating). Modeling is typically used for creating the base geometry of objects, characters, environments, etc. It's a precise, control-oriented approach that can involve manipulating individual vertices, edges, and faces of a mesh. Techniques like NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) and polygons are commonly used in modeling to create smooth surfaces and complex structures, respectively.

**Sculpting**, on the other hand, is more akin to working with digital clay. It allows for a more intuitive and artistic process, where artists use various brushes to push, pull, smooth, carve, and otherwise manipulate the mesh to add fine details, textures, and shapes that would be difficult or time-consuming to achieve through traditional modeling techniques. Sculpting is especially popular for creating organic forms, such as characters and creatures, because it enables the artist to work in a manner similar to traditional clay sculpting, adding details like wrinkles, muscles, and expressions with relative ease.

Both modeling and sculpting are essential in the 3D creation process, and artists often use them together. For instance, an artist might start with modeling to create the basic shape of a character or object and then switch to sculpting to add detailed features and textures. After sculpting, a process called retopology is often used to create a new, lower-polygon mesh that accurately captures the detailed surface created during sculpting, making it more suitable for animation and rendering.

Modern 3D software, such as Blender, Maya, and ZBrush, provide tools for both modeling and sculpting, allowing artists to choose the best approach for their specific needs at any stage of the creation process.
