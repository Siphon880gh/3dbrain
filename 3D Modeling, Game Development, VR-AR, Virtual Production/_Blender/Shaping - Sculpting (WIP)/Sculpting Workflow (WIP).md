You create basic shapes and manipulate them into a base layer for which you can sculpt.

You go into Sculpting module. You sculpt, and as you sculpt, you go from low poly to higher poly (CTRL+1, CTRL+2, etc) with subdivision surface modifiers

When you're ready to paint, you go into Vertex Paint editor mode.
