During an extrusion, escape-cancel leaves extra vertex

When extruded from an edge or vertex, you can press Escape to cancel, however it still created a duplicate. You can box select then merge by distance (M â†’ merge by distance). Or after you press escape, you can undo (CMD+Z) to remove the extra.
