General model downloading tips:

Anything above 15k triangles aka polygons is pretty heavy model. Especially if doesnt have a lot of details, look for something ifferent. If detailed model with millions of polygons, it's worth it (likely 3d scan)


obj is original format. fbx is good. glTF is great because it's most compatible with 3d rendering software
