Connect your subdomain to EC2 instance

1. **Create an EC2 Instance:**
    
    - When you create an Amazon EC2 instance, you can choose to launch it in a public or private subnet. If you want it to be accessible from the internet, you should launch it in a public subnet.
2. **Security Groups:**
    
    - You need to configure the security groups associated with the EC2 instance to allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
3. **Elastic IP or Public IP:**
    
    - By default, EC2 instances are assigned a public IP address, but this address changes every time the instance is stopped and started. To have a static public IP address, you can allocate an Elastic IP and associate it with your instance.
4. **Domain and DNS Records:**
    
    - Once the EC2 instance is accessible via the internet, you can create a DNS A record to point a subdomain to the public IP address (or Elastic IP) of the EC2 instance. This is typically done through the DNS management interface provided by your domain registrar.
5. **Route 53 (Optional):**
    
    - If you are using Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service, you can create a hosted zone for your domain and manage the DNS records directly within AWS.

Here’s a simplified step-by-step process:

1. Launch an EC2 instance in a public subnet.
2. Configure security groups to allow incoming traffic.
3. (Optional) Allocate and associate an Elastic IP with the EC2 instance.
4. Create an A record in your DNS management interface to point a subdomain to the IP address of the EC2 instance.

After completing these steps, the EC2 instance should be accessible from the internet via the subdomain. Keep in mind that exposing services to the internet involves security risks, so it’s crucial to follow best practices for security, such as keeping software up to date and configuring firewalls and security groups appropriately.
