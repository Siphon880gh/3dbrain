## \<< Apple Apps keep getting denied by Apple because they claim crashes on devices
Android is less likely to have a device crash from the same app than iPhone. Apple keeps denying the app because it crashes on some device. Our Android version gets accepted.

\>>
The difference in acceptance between your Android and iOS app versions could be attributed to several factors related to platform-specific characteristics and the app review processes of Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Different Review Processes**: Apple's App Store is known for its stringent review process compared to the Google Play Store. Apple performs more in-depth checks, which includes testing apps on various devices and iOS versions for stability, performance, and adherence to guidelines.
    
2. **Hardware and OS Variability**: Android apps are developed for a wide range of devices with varying hardware specifications and OS versions, leading developers to inherently focus on broader compatibility and handling a variety of scenarios. In contrast, iOS apps are often optimized for a more limited range of devices and OS versions, which might lead to overlooked issues in less common configurations.
    
3. **Development and Testing Environments**: Differences in development tools and testing environments between iOS and Android can also lead to varying outcomes. For instance, certain bugs might not be evident in the iOS simulator but could occur on actual devices due to hardware-specific issues.
    
4. **App Architecture and Frameworks**: If the app is developed using cross-platform tools or frameworks, there might be nuances in how these frameworks interact with the underlying OS. Certain issues might manifest only on iOS due to differences in how the framework utilizes native components.
    
5. **iOS-Specific Features and Guidelines**: iOS has specific guidelines and features (like app permissions, background processing, etc.) that might not have direct equivalents in Android. Issues in handling these iOS-specific elements could lead to crashes.
    
6. **Memory Management and Performance**: iOS devices might handle memory management and performance differently than Android devices. An issue that doesn’t impact an Android device might cause a crash on an iPhone, especially if it’s related to resource-intensive operations or memory usage.
    

To address the issue:

- **Thorough Testing on iOS Devices**: Use services like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs, as mentioned earlier, to test your app on a range of iOS devices and OS versions.
- **Code Analysis and Profiling**: Use Xcode's Instruments and other profiling tools to analyze your app's performance and resource usage.
- **Review Crash Reports and Logs**: Analyze crash reports from Apple in detail. Implement extensive logging to gather more data during testing.
- **Beta Testing**: Use TestFlight for broader beta testing on iOS to catch issues that might occur in real-world usage scenarios.

Understanding and addressing platform-specific nuances is crucial in multi-platform app development. It's often a balance between leveraging the strengths of each platform while maintaining a consistent user experience.

## \<< Debugging how we would normally
Apple gave crash report. How to find out where the problem is and freeze the code during runtime like a debugger at the crash so I can inspect variables

Analyzing and debugging a crash report from Apple can be a detailed process, but here are the general steps you should follow:

1. **Symbolicate the Crash Report**: First, you need to symbolicate the crash report. This means converting the memory addresses in the crash log to human-readable class names and line numbers. Xcode usually does this automatically if you have the dSYM file that corresponds to the build that crashed.
    
2. **Analyze the Stack Trace**: The stack trace will show the series of method calls that led up to the crash. Look for the part of the stack trace that enters your code—this is likely where the issue originated.
    
3. **Set Breakpoints**: Once you've identified the problematic area, you can set breakpoints in Xcode in the suspected methods or lines of code. This will allow you to pause execution there during debugging.
    
4. **Reproduce the Crash**: Run your app in the debugger and try to reproduce the crash. When the execution stops at your breakpoint, you can inspect variables, view the call stack, and step through code to analyze the behavior leading up to the crash.
    
5. **Use Exception Breakpoints**: In Xcode, you can set an 'Exception Breakpoint' which will pause execution when an exception is thrown. This can help catch issues at the point of failure.
    
6. **Check for Memory Issues**: Sometimes crashes are due to memory issues. Tools like Instruments (part of Xcode) can help analyze memory usage and detect leaks.
    
7. **Look for Thread Issues**: If the crash is related to threading (like trying to update the UI from a background thread), the stack trace and debugger can help identify where this is happening.
    
8. **Inspect Variables and Memory**: While paused at a breakpoint, inspect the variables in scope to look for unexpected or invalid values that might be causing the crash.
    
9. **Consult Logs**: Look at any logs you might have added to your app for additional context about what was happening when the crash occurred.
    
10. **Iterate**: Debugging can be iterative. You might need to adjust your breakpoints, add more logs, and run multiple debugging sessions to fully understand the issue.
    

Remember, every crash and its context are unique, so these steps might vary slightly based on the specific nature of your problem. Being methodical and patient is key to successful debugging.

## \<< Debugging but it's difficult without the devices Apple claims it crashed on
What you mentioned requires access to the iPhone the app crashed in with XCode opened. It's hard to replicate this error so I can check the variables and test revision of my code on XCode. You mentioned online services that lets you test on all iPhone devices. Can I run Xcode with those devices? If I simulate that device, would it not be an accurate reflection of the devices on the online test services?

\>>
You're correct that replicating the exact environment and conditions of a crash can be challenging, especially when you don't have access to the specific device where the crash occurred. Here's some more information regarding your questions:

1. **Using Xcode with Online Testing Services**: Most cloud-based testing services do not allow you to run Xcode directly on their devices. These services typically provide a platform for running automated tests or manual testing sessions on a variety of devices, but they don't integrate directly with Xcode for live debugging.
    
2. **Simulators vs. Real Devices**: Xcode's simulators are useful for a broad range of testing scenarios, but they don't perfectly replicate the hardware and environmental conditions of real devices. This means that some issues, particularly those related to hardware, memory usage, or specific device configurations, might not be apparent in simulators.
    
3. **Alternative Approaches**:
    
    - **Extensive Logging**: Implement extensive logging in your app. This way, when you run tests on cloud devices, you can gather detailed logs that might help identify where and why the crash occurs.
    - **Remote Debugging Tools**: There are tools available that can provide more detailed crash reports or even allow for some level of remote debugging. For example, services like Instabug or Sentry offer in-depth crash reporting which might give you more context than standard crash reports.
    - **TestFlight Beta Testing**: You can distribute your app to a broader audience using TestFlight. Sometimes, beta testers might encounter and report the crash, providing additional data points to help isolate the issue.
4. **Replicating the Crash**: Try to replicate the user environment as closely as possible. This includes:
    
    - Using the same iOS version and device model as mentioned in the crash report.
    - Trying to understand and mimic the user's actions that led to the crash.
    - Testing under similar network conditions or other environmental factors.
5. **Crash Analytics Tools**: Incorporate advanced crash analytics tools into your app. Tools like Firebase Crashlytics can provide more detailed reports and may help in pinpointing the exact line of code causing the issue.
    

In summary, while online services for device testing are valuable for a broad range of tests, they might not fully replace the need for local testing and debugging in some complex crash scenarios. Combining these services with thorough logging, beta testing, and possibly third-party crash reporting tools can provide a more comprehensive approach to identifying and resolving crashes.
