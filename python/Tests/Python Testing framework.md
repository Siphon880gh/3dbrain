Yes, in Python, you can group assertions into units, which is typically done in the context of unit testing. Python’s `unittest` framework allows you to create test cases by subclassing `unittest.TestCase`. Inside these test case classes, you can define methods that will each run as a unit test, and within those methods, you can use multiple assertions to validate your code.

Here's an example of how you can group assertions into a unit test:

```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_addition(self):
        # Grouped assertions for addition
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)

    def test_multiplication(self):
        # Grouped assertions for multiplication
        self.assertEqual(multiply(2, 3), 6)
        self.assertEqual(multiply(-1, 3), -3)
        self.assertEqual(multiply(0, 10), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, the `TestMathOperations` class has two methods: `test_addition` and `test_multiplication`. Each method groups assertions for different scenarios of a specific function. When you run this test case class, `unittest` will report the results for each test method, telling you which tests passed and which failed.

Each test method is essentially a "unit" that groups together assertions related to a particular aspect of the program. This is the core idea behind unit testing – testing individual components (units) of the program in isolation to ensure that each part is working correctly.
