The `//` operator in Python represents floor division. It divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down to the nearest whole number if necessary, and returns an integer result.

So when you see an expression like `(image.width - text_width) // 2` or `(image.height - text_height) // 2`, it's calculating the midpoint coordinate of the image's width or height, respectively, by subtracting the size of the text (either its width or height) and then dividing by 2 to get to the center.

For example, if an image is 800 pixels wide and the text is 100 pixels wide, then the expression `(800 - 100) // 2` would be evaluated as:

- Subtract the width of the text from the width of the image: `800 - 100 = 700`
- Divide the result by 2 to find the midpoint: `700 // 2 = 350`

The result of `350` would then be the x-coordinate where you would start drawing the text to have it centered on the x-axis of the image.

Using floor division is helpful here to ensure that the resulting x and y coordinates are whole numbers, which is required for pixel coordinates in image processing. Floating point numbers would not make sense as pixel coordinates because you cannot have a fraction of a pixel.

Then what's the operator for ceiling division?

\>>
Python does not have a built-in operator for ceiling division like it does for floor division (`//`). However, you can achieve ceiling division by using a combination of division and the `math.ceil` function from the math module.

Here's how you can perform ceiling division for two numbers `a` and `b`:

```python
import math

# For ceiling division of a by b
a = 7
b = 2
result = math.ceil(a / b)
```

What `math.ceil(a / b)` does is it first performs the division `a / b`, which results in a floating-point number, and then `math.ceil` takes that result and rounds it up to the nearest whole number.

So in this example:

- `a / b` calculates to `3.5`
- `math.ceil(3.5)` then rounds this up to `4`

There is also a trick to achieve ceiling division without using the `math.ceil` function by adding `b - 1` to the numerator before performing floor division:

```python
# Ceiling division of a by b without math.ceil
result = (a + b - 1) // b
```

In this approach:

- For `a = 7` and `b = 2`, you add `2 - 1` to `7`, getting `7 + 1 = 8`
- Then you use floor division: `8 // 2` which equals `4`

This trick works because adding `b - 1` to the numerator ensures that when `a` is not a multiple of `b`, the floor division rounds up to the next whole number. If `a` is already a multiple of `b`, then adding `b - 1` does not change the outcomeâ€”it would still be the same as if you used `math.ceil`.
