In the context of grayscale images or maps where you can set either black or white, white is considered the high value, and black is considered the low value.

- **White:** Represents the maximum or highest value for the property being controlled by the map. For example, in a height map, white would indicate the highest point, while in a metallic map, white would indicate a fully metallic surface.

- **Black:** Represents the minimum or lowest value for the property. In a height map, black would indicate the lowest point, and in a metallic map, black would indicate a non-metallic surface.

The gradient between black and white represents the range of values for the specific property being controlled. Intermediate shades of gray between black and white represent values between the minimum and maximum, allowing for smooth transitions and fine-tuning of material properties in computer graphics.
