## Initial Setup:

Enable WASD for cameras in editing mode, especially if you’re right handed. Your left hand manipulates camera with WASD + Q/E with or without modifier keys --WITH-- the right hand using the mouse, or click and dragging, or using the mouse’s scroll. If on a laptop, your right hand can be using the mouse trackpad.

Go: Unreal Editor → Preferences → Search WASD
Flight Camera Control Type: Use WASD for Camera Controls

Reworded:
Crane: Moves the camera up and down while keeping its orientation.
Dolly: Moves the camera forward and backward along its local Z-axis.
Truck: Moves the camera left and right along its local X-axis.
Orbit: Rotate around a subject or a scene, giving a gyroscopic feel to the camera movement. It's a common feature in 3D software for inspecting objects from various angles or for navigating around a scene. It’s a relatively newer concept, some people calling it gyroing or arching.
Tilt: Mouse scroll up / down
