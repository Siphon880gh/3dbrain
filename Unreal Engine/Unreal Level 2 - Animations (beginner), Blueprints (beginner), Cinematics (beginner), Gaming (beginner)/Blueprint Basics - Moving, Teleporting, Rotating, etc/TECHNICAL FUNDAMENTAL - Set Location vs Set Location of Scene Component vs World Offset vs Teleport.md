In Unreal Engine's Blueprint system, when you're working to modify the location of a `BPThirdPersonCharacter` or any other Actor, the choice of node depends on the context and how you want to manipulate the location. However, the most commonly used nodes for directly setting the location of an Actor, including characters, are:

1. **Set Actor Location**: This node is specifically designed to change the location of an Actor in the world. It's the most straightforward choice for adjusting the position of your `BPThirdPersonCharacter`. You provide it with a new location vector (X, Y, Z coordinates), and it moves the Actor to that location. It also has an option to sweep, which, if enabled, prevents the Actor from moving through other colliding Actors.
    
2. **Set Location (of Scene Component)**: This node is used to set the location of a specific component within an Actor, such as a mesh or a camera. If you're looking to adjust the position of a component within your `BPThirdPersonCharacter`, rather than moving the entire Actor, this would be the appropriate choice. Each Actor is composed of components, and sometimes you might want to adjust these individually.
    
3. **Teleport To**: This node teleports an Actor to a specified location and rotation instantly without any interpolation. It's similar to "Set Actor Location" but also allows you to set the rotation simultaneously. This node is useful for instantaneously moving characters or objects without considering physics interactions during the movement.
    
4. **Add Actor World Offset**: While not directly setting a location, this node moves an Actor by a certain offset from its current position. It's useful for making relative adjustments to an Actor's location (e.g., moving forward by X units) rather than setting an absolute location.
    

For most cases where you're simply moving your `BPThirdPersonCharacter` to a new location, **Set Actor Location** is the appropriate choice. It directly affects the Actor's position in the world and is straightforward to use. Just ensure you select the node that targets Actors, not components, unless you have a specific need to adjust a component's location within your character.
