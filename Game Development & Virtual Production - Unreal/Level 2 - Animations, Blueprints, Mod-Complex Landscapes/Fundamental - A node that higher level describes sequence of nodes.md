The Sequence node in Blueprints works by executing its output pins in order, one after another. When the Sequence node is triggered, it starts with the first 'Then' output pin (Then 0), completes the execution of all the connected nodes on that pin, and then moves on to the next 'Then' output pin (Then 1), and so on.
