If you see only bits of the texture of a new Qbridge item dropped into Viewport, move your camera behind it. You may be on the side that is transparent. Commonly, items may have one side thatâ€™s opaque to save rendering/performance time while editing. You'll have to rotate/translate the opaque side into the camera view.
