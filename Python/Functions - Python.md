In Python, functions are defined with the `def` keyword, and within the parentheses following the function name, you can specify arguments or parameters that the function expects when it is called. These arguments allow you to pass data into the function to influence its behavior or to operate on. There are several types of arguments/parameters that Python functions can accept:

1. **Positional arguments**: These are arguments that need to be included in the proper position or order. The number of arguments and their positions in the function call must match those in the function definition.

2. **Keyword arguments**: When calling a function, you can specify arguments by name. This allows you to skip over some arguments if they have default values, or if you want to only specify some arguments out of order.

3. **Default parameters**: When defining a function, you can provide a default value for an argument. This value is used if the argument is not provided during the function call.

4. **Variable-length arguments**: Sometimes you might want to define a function that can accept an arbitrary number of arguments. This is done using the `*args` syntax for a list of arguments, and `**kwargs` for a dictionary of keyword arguments.

Here's how these work with a few examples:

```python
# A simple function with one positional argument
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!

# A function with one positional argument and one with a default value
def greet_again(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

greet_again("Bob")                    # Output: Hello, Bob!
greet_again("Bob", greeting="Hi")     # Output: Hi, Bob!

# A function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments
def fruits(*args):
    for fruit in args:
        print(fruit)

fruits("apple", "banana", "cherry")  # Outputs each fruit on a new line

# A function that accepts arbitrary keyword arguments
def fruit_basket(**kwargs):
    for fruit, quantity in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{fruit}: {quantity}")

fruit_basket(apple=10, banana=20, cherry=30)
# Output: apple: 10
#         banana: 20
#         cherry: 30
```

In the above examples:

- `greet` takes a single argument, and you must provide it when you call the function.
- `greet_again` can be called with just the `name` argument because `greeting` has a default value.
- `fruits` can take any number of positional arguments, which are accessible as a tuple inside the function.
- `fruit_basket` can take any number of keyword arguments, which are accessible as a dictionary inside the function.

In more complex scenarios, you can mix these types of arguments in a single function, but you must follow the order: positional arguments, followed by any `*args`, keyword arguments, and then any `**kwargs`.
