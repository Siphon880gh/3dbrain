In Python, a tuple is an immutable data type, which means once it is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This is one of the key differences between tuples and lists, where lists are mutable and their elements can be modified.

For example, if you have a tuple t = (1, 2, 3), you cannot change one of the values directly like t[0] = 4. Attempting to do so will result in a **TypeError**.

If you need a data structure similar to a tuple but with the ability to change its elements, you would typically use a list. 

However, if you need to "modify" a tuple, you would create a new tuple by taking portions of the old tuple and adding the new elements. For instance:
```
u = (4, t[1], t[2])
```
