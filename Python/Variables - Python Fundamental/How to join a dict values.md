To join the values from a dictionary into a single string, you'll need to iterate over the dictionary values, convert them to strings (if they are not already), and then use the `join()` method to concatenate them into a single string. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```python
# A dictionary with mixed data types as values
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 'banana', 'c': 2.5}

# Convert each value to a string and then join them with a separator
# Here we use a space as a separator
joined_string = ' '.join(str(value) for value in my_dict.values())

print(joined_string) # Output will be something like: '1 banana 2.5'
```

If you want to join the values without any spaces or other separators, just use an empty string with the `join()` method:

```python
# Join without any separators
joined_string = ''.join(str(value) for value in my_dict.values())

print(joined_string) # Output will be something like: '1banana2.5'
```

Remember that the order of the values when using `.values()` in a dictionary is not guaranteed to be the same every time, especially in versions of Python before 3.7. From Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries preserve the order of insertion. If the order is important, you should sort the values or keys first, depending on the requirement.
