This runs if Im running the script directly rather than using as a module?
  if __name__ == "__main__":

Yes, that's correct. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to determine whether a Python script is being run directly or being imported as a module into another script.

When you run a Python script directly (for example, `python3 script.py` from the command line), Python sets the special variable `__name__` to `"__main__"`. So the code within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block will execute.

However, if you import the script as a module into another script (for example, `import script` in another Python file), `__name__` is set to the name of the script/module (`"script"` in this case), and the code within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block will not execute.

This mechanism allows a script to be used both as a runnable script and as a module. For example, if you want to use the `generate` function in another script, you would import it like this:

```python
# another_script.py
from script import generate

# Now you can call generate() directly
generate("Some text to generate speech from")
