In Python 2, you can print a string using the `print` statement. The syntax is straightforward. For example, to print the string "str", you would write:

```python
print "str"
```

Unlike Python 3, Python 2 does not require parentheses around the string in the `print` statement. However, using parentheses is also valid in Python 2 and can be helpful for compatibility with Python 3. For example:

```python
print("str")
```

Both of these examples would output `str` to the console.
