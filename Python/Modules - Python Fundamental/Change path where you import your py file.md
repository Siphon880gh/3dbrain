In python can I import a module that is outside the current folder? Like ../libs

Yes, in Python, you can import a module that is located outside the current folder. To do so, you need to modify the `sys.path`, which is a list of strings representing the paths that Python will search for modules. 

Here's an example of how you can do it:

1. First, you need to import the `sys` module.

2. Then, append the path of the directory containing the module to `sys.path`.

3. Finally, import the module as usual.

Here's a simple code snippet to demonstrate this:

```python
import sys

# Add the parent directory to sys.path
sys.path.append('../')

# Now you can import your module from the libs directory
from libs import your_module
```

In this example, `../libs` is the path to the directory where your module is located. Make sure to replace `your_module` with the actual name of the module you want to import.

Keep in mind that modifying `sys.path` like this can potentially lead to conflicts if different directories contain modules with the same name. It's usually better to structure your project in a way that avoids the need for such imports, possibly by using packages.
