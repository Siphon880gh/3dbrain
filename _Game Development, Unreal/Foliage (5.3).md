Environments that are free often have plants. Go into Description to see in detail what assets they offer (aka trees, plants). Add to your project. Go to Foliage Mode (Away from Lit mode) from the top left. Then click Paint tab. Now you can add to your level/map.  

Go into Foliage Mode (from selection Mode dropdown) → Paint 

Click Add Foliage button and select from the dropdown (there should be foliage to select if you successfully “Add to Project” earlier)

Then move your mouse over the level and you’ll see a mass effect overlay - that will be where the grass will randomly spawn in. Click to confirm.

  
When you click Erase, there will be another mass effect overlay that will erase the grass in the area you click.
