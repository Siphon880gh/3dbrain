## Classic Mode

Classic Mode allows you to fine tune the layout and design with the shortcodes of WPBakery (AKA VIsual Composer) which is the backbone of Salient theme's site builder

ChatGPT Explanation:
[vc_row_inner column_margin="100px" column_direction="default" column_direction_tablet="default" column_direction_phone="default" bottom_padding="50" text_align="left" row_position="default" row_position_tablet="inherit" row_position_phone="inherit" overflow="visible" pointer_events="all"]

The text you've provided does indeed look like a shortcode, specifically one that seems to be associated with a page builder plugin rather than WordPress core. The structure [shortcode] is characteristic of WordPress shortcodes, but the details inside the brackets can vary widely depending on the plugin or theme that adds them.
In your example, [vc_row_inner ...] is likely a shortcode from a visual composer or page builder plugin. These plugins often add their own set of shortcodes to help users design and structure their web pages with various layouts and elements. The attributes within the shortcode, like column_margin, text_align, overflow, etc., are parameters that control the appearance and behavior of the content or layout element that the shortcode represents.
Such shortcodes are particularly useful for creating complex page layouts and designs without requiring users to have in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, or PHP. They're a popular feature in many WordPress themes and plugins, especially those focused on customizability and visual editing.
