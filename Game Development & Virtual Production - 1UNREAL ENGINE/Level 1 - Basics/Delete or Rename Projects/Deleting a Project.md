Why: 
- You may have to tidy up your project list with Unreal Editor.
- Deleting your project is a manual task in Unreal. They haven’t made a good UI for deleting projects as of Q3 2023.


You must do all these steps
In Unreal Project Browser, right click file → Show in Finder. 

Go up one folder so it contains all the files. Delete the entire project folder.

Restart the Unreal Editor Browser to have the project removed officially.
