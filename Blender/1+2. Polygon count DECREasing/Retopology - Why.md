Use Case:
You downloaded a model online and see there are too many vertexes:

Repotology will lower the amount of vertexes so you can rig the character properly, otherwise, vertexes are left out, your animation is jaggy/deformed, etc.

You're on your way performing various Retopology techniques:

By adding vertexes/faces overlaying on model, then later merging it with the old vertexes, these less vertexes/faces can serve as the new weight paintable geometries for rigging/animation the armature/bones.

Retopology in Blender, or any 3D modeling software, facilitates easier and more efficient rigging for several reasons. Retopology is the process of restructuring the mesh topology of a 3D model to create a new mesh that is more optimized and suitable for animation. Here's why retopology can make rigging easier:

1. **Optimized Geometry:** Retopology creates a mesh with optimized geometry that has fewer polygons but still maintains the essential form and details of the model. This optimization makes the model less resource-intensive, allowing for smoother rigging and animation processes.

2. **Uniform Flow of Edges:** By creating a mesh with a uniform flow of edges, retopology ensures that deformations during animation look more natural. This is especially important around joints and areas of the model that will undergo significant movement. Uniform edge flow helps in creating more predictable and controlled deformations.

3. **Better Weight Painting:** Weight painting, which defines how the mesh moves in relation to the bones of the rig, becomes more straightforward with a retopologized mesh. The cleaner, more evenly distributed topology allows for easier and more accurate assignment of weights, reducing the time spent on tweaking and adjustments.

4. **Quads vs. Triangles:** Retopology often involves creating a mesh primarily composed of quadrilateral polygons (quads). Quads are preferred for animation because they deform more predictably than triangles or n-gons (polygons with more than four vertices), making the rigging process more efficient and the animations smoother.

5. **Fewer Artifacts:** A well-retopologized model will have fewer artifacts during animation, such as pinching or stretching in unintended ways. This means animators and riggers spend less time fixing issues and more time on the creative aspects of animation.

6. **Facilitates LOD (Level of Detail) Creation:** Retopology can be used to create multiple levels of detail for a model, from high detail for close-up shots to low detail for distant shots. This is particularly useful in rigging for games and films where resource management is critical.

7. **Compatibility with Simulation:** For models that require cloth, hair, or flesh simulations, a clean, retopologized mesh ensures these simulations behave more realistically. Simulations depend heavily on the underlying mesh structure, and a well-organized topology can greatly enhance the end results.

Blender offers tools like the QuadriFlow remesher and manual retopology tools that make the process of retopology more accessible to artists. This approach to preparing models for rigging and animation not only saves time but also greatly enhances the quality of the final animations.
