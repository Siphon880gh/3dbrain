What if the angle is all weird and you can't rotate around the object like you wanted?

For example, here I can't rotate or tilt to the other side of the character model no matter how hard I tried

Select Camera in outliner:

Make sure your viewport is set to the camera so you'll see the changes:

Go into Object mode so you can change the camera's properties (the object you're on is the camera, so object mode will change camera properties):

Here you can adjust rotation and location to fix the angle in your veiwport so you can be more productive
