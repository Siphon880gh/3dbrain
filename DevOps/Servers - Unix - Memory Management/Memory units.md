Here's a simplified table to explain the conversions from bits to terabytes, noting that each step up converts by a factor of 1024 (except for the initial step from bits to bytes which is a factor of 8, since there are 8 bits in a byte):

|Unit|Equivalent|
|---|---|
|1 Byte|8 bits|
|1 Kilobyte (KB)|1,024 Bytes (2^10 Bytes)|
|1 Megabyte (MB)|1,024 KB (2^20 Bytes)|
|1 Gigabyte (GB)|1,024 MB (2^30 Bytes)|
|1 Terabyte (TB)|1,024 GB (2^40 Bytes)|

This table demonstrates the hierarchy of data measurement units from bits, the smallest unit of data, to terabytes, a significantly larger unit of data. Each unit is a factor of 1024 larger than the unit before it (with the exception of the conversion from bits to bytes). This is because computers operate using binary (base-2) number systems, and 1024 is a power of 2 (2^10). This exponential growth illustrates how quickly data can accumulate and expand in size from very small individual pieces (bits) to much larger and more substantial collections of data (terabytes).
