Mac OS is based on Unix, but it is not Linux. Here are some key differences between Mac, Unix, and Linux:

- Mac OS is an operating system developed by Apple exclusively for their Macintosh computers. It has a Unix core but includes Apple's own technologies like Aqua GUI, Darwin, etc.

- Unix is a family of operating systems that are based on the original AT&T Unix OS. Many commercial Unix variants exist like Solaris, AIX, HP-UX etc. 

- Linux is an open-source Unix-like operating system kernel that can be packaged into Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian etc. Linux is based on the Linux kernel started by Linus Torvalds.

So in summary:

- Mac OS has a Unix foundation but includes Apple's own technologies so it is not pure Unix. 

- Mac is based on Unix but is not considered a Linux distribution as it does not use the Linux kernel.

- Linux is built on a Unix-like architecture but Linux refers specifically to the Linux kernel and associated GNU components that make up Linux distributions.

So while Mac, Linux and Unix share some core similarities in their foundations, Mac differs by being a proprietary OS on top of Unix, while Linux is an open source OS using the Linux kernel and GNU components.
