Dev Python Resizing image

In Python, if you're trying to resize an image, you typically use a library like PIL/Pillow, OpenCV, or another image processing library, since there's no built-in `resize_image` function in Python's standard library.

Here's how you can resize an image using the Pillow library, which is a fork of PIL (Python Imaging Library):

1. First, you need to install the Pillow library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

2. Then, you can use the `resize` method of an `Image` object to resize your image:

```python
from PIL import Image

def resize_image(input_image_path, output_image_path, size):
    original_image = Image.open(input_image_path)
    resized_image = original_image.resize(size)
    resized_image.save(output_image_path)

# Usage
resize_image('path_to_your_original_image.jpg', 'path_to_save_resized_image.jpg', (800, 600))
```

In the above code:
- `input_image_path` is the path to the image you want to resize.
- `output_image_path` is the path where you want to save the resized image.
- `size` is a tuple of the desired width and height (e.g., `(800, 600)`).

And if you are using OpenCV, the function you'd be looking for is `cv2.resize`. Here's how you'd use it:

```python
import cv2

def resize_image(input_image_path, output_image_path, size):
    # Read the image from file
    image = cv2.imread(input_image_path)
    # Resize the image
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, size, interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA)
    # Save the image back to disk
    cv2.imwrite(output_image_path, resized_image)

# Usage
resize_image('path_to_your_original_image.jpg', 'path_to_save_resized_image.jpg', (800, 600))
```

In this OpenCV example:
- `size` is again a tuple of the desired width and height, but note that OpenCV uses width x height, not height x width.
- `cv2.INTER_AREA` is an optional argument specifying the interpolation method; `INTER_AREA` is typically used for shrinking.

If you've seen `resize_image` used somewhere as a standalone function, it's possible that it's a custom function defined in the codebase you're looking at, or it's part of a specific library you're supposed to use. You'll need to refer to that specific context or documentation for how to use such a function.


Certainly! To implement a `resize_image` function, you would typically use an image processing library like PIL (Python Imaging Library), which is now known as Pillow. The function would take an image and a zoom factor and return a resized image.

Here is a simple implementation using Pillow:

```python
from PIL import Image

def resize_image(image, zoom_factor):
    # Calculate the new size, maintaining the aspect ratio
    new_size = tuple([int(dim * zoom_factor) for dim in image.size])

    # Resize the image using the calculated size
    # Image.ANTIALIAS is a high-quality downsampling filter
    resized_image = image.resize(new_size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    return resized_image
```

You would use this function in your loop like so:

```python
from PIL import Image

# ... other code ...

for i in range(frames_img1):
    # Assuming img1 is a PIL Image object
    img1_zoom = resize_image(img1, zoom_factor)
    # Assuming 'out' is a video file writer that can handle image frames
    out.write(img1_zoom)
```

Make sure that you have Pillow installed in your Python environment, which you can do using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

Keep in mind that resizing an image to a larger size than the original can make it pixelated since it's interpolating the new pixels. Also, if you are zooming in on an image, you might want to crop it to the original dimensions after resizing to give the appearance of a camera zoom. Here's how you might do that:

```python
def zoom_and_crop(image, frame_number, total_frames, zoom_start, zoom_end, final_size):
    # Calculate the current zoom factor
    zoom_factor = zoom_start + (frame_number / total_frames) * (zoom_end - zoom_start)
    
    # Resize the image using the zoom factor
    resized_image = resize_image(image, zoom_factor)
    
    # Calculate the new size, maintaining the aspect ratio
    width, height = final_size
    new_width, new_height = resized_image.size

    # Center the crop
    left = (new_width - width) / 2
    top = (new_height - height) / 2
    right = (new_width + width) / 2
    bottom = (new_height + height) / 2

    # Crop the image to the final size
    cropped_image = resized_image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))

    return cropped_image
```

Then, in your loop, you would use `zoom_and_crop` instead of `resize_image`. The `final_size` should be the size of the frames in your output video, so that after zooming in, you crop the image back down to the size that fits the video frame.

For my python code that resizes an image:

```
def resize_image_zooming(image, zoom_factor):
    # Calculate the new size, maintaining the aspect ratio
    new_size = tuple([int(dim * zoom_factor) for dim in image.size])


    # Resize the image using the calculated size
    # Image.ANTIALIAS is a high-quality downsampling filter
    resized_image = image.resize(new_size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    return resized_image
```


I get the error:
  File "/Users/wengffung/dev/web/storyway/slideshow-creator/libs/motion_effects.py", line 9, in resize_image_zooming
    new_size = tuple([int(dim * zoom_factor) for dim in image.size])
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

The image Im passing in is from cv2, so I think it's a NumPy
\>>
If the image you're passing to the function is indeed a NumPy array (which is the standard format for images in OpenCV), you'll need to modify the function to work with NumPy's array representation of images.

The size of a NumPy array can be obtained using the `shape` attribute, which returns a tuple. However, you need to be aware that the `shape` of an OpenCV image array is in the format `(height, width, channels)`, unlike PIL's `(width, height)`. Also, OpenCV's `resize` function should be used instead of PIL's.

Here's how you could rewrite the `resize_image_zooming` function for an OpenCV image:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def resize_image_zooming(image, zoom_factor):
    """
    Resizes an image by a zoom factor while maintaining aspect ratio.
    
    :param image: NumPy array representing the image to be resized.
    :param zoom_factor: float representing the zoom factor.
    :return: Resized NumPy array representing the image.
    """
    if not isinstance(image, np.ndarray):
        raise TypeError("The 'image' argument must be a NumPy array.")

    # OpenCV format for shape is (height, width, channels)
    height, width = image.shape[:2]

    # Calculate the new size
    new_width = int(width * zoom_factor)
    new_height = int(height * zoom_factor)

    # Resize the image using OpenCV's resize function
    resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)

    return resized_image
```

And here's how you'd use this function with an image loaded using OpenCV:

```python
# Load the image using OpenCV
original_image = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image.jpg')

# Specify the zoom factor
zoom_factor = 1.5 # For example, to increase size by 50%

# Resize the image
resized_image = resize_image_zooming(original_image, zoom_factor)

# If you want to display the image using OpenCV
cv2.imshow('Resized Image', resized_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In the `resize_image_zooming` function, the `cv2.resize` function is used to resize the image, and `cv2.INTER_AREA` is used for interpolation, which is a good default choice. If you're upsizing the image, `cv2.INTER_LINEAR` or `cv2.INTER_CUBIC` might yield better results.
