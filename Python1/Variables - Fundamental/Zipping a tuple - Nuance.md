You have two arrays, and you're taking from each array in parallel to form tuples of two items at a time

```
`zip(image_paths, subtitles)` pairs up the elements of `image_paths` with `subtitles` into a tuple. For example, if `image_paths = ['path1.jpg', 'path2.jpg']` and `subtitles = ['subtitle1', 'subtitle2']`, `zip` would create an iterator over the pairs `[('path1.jpg', 'subtitle1'), ('path2.jpg', 'subtitle2')]`.
