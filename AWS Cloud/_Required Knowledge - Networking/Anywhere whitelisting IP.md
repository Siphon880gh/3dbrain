That's 0.0.0.0

For quick launching of EC2 that you want to manage in a SSH terminal on your computer, you can mark allowed IP addresses to SSH as 0.0.0.0

The more secured approach is listing your actual computer's internet connection IP address. Even more secured, you can turn on and off the SSH at the AWS dashboard before connecting and after disconnecting
