## Creating cube on webpage (Testing works)

Using Three.js on your website involves several steps. Here's a basic guide to get you started:

1. **Include Three.js in Your Project:**
   - You can download Three.js from the [official website](https://threejs.org/) or include it via a CDN.
   - If you're using a package manager like npm, you can install it using `npm install three`.

   For example, to include via CDN, add this in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Set Up the Scene:**
   - Create a scene where all your objects, cameras, and lights will live.
   ```javascript
   const scene = new THREE.Scene();
   ```

3. **Create a Camera:**
   - The camera defines what we'll see when we render the scene.
   - A common choice is the `PerspectiveCamera`.
   ```javascript
   const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
   camera.position.z = 5;
   ```

4. **Create a Renderer:**
   - The renderer displays the scene using WebGL.
   - Append the renderer's DOM element to your HTML.
   ```javascript
   const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
   renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
   document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
   ```

5. **Add Objects:**
   - Create objects like cubes, spheres, etc., and add them to the scene.
   ```javascript
   const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
   const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
   const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
   scene.add(cube);
   ```

6. **Create a Render Loop:**
   - This will continuously render the scene.
   ```javascript
   function animate() {
       requestAnimationFrame(animate);

       // Update objects
       cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
       cube.rotation.y += 0.01;

       renderer.render(scene, camera);
   }
   animate();
   ```

7. **Handle Window Resize:**
   - Adjust the camera and renderer size when the window is resized.
   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
      camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
      camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
      renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
   }, false);
   ```

8. **Additional Features:**
   - Three.js allows for more complex features like animations, lighting, textures, and more. You can explore these as you get more comfortable with the basics.

Remember, Three.js is a powerful library and this is just a starting point. As you progress, you'll learn to create more complex and interactive 3D graphics. For more detailed information and tutorials, the [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/) is a fantastic resource.


## Incorporate your model done from editor
Your model/scene could be from the Three JS Editor; Or it could've been from another 3d modeling editor like Blender, or could be from a library like sketchfab, 3dfree, turbosquid, etc.

For the code snippet, lets say it's a glTF model:

The process of incorporating a character model into your website using Three.js involves some additional steps compared to adding simple geometrical objects like cubes or spheres. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Export Your Model:**
   - From the Three.js editor, you can export your model. Typically, models are exported in formats like `.glTF` (recommended), `.OBJ`, or `.FBX`.

2. **Include Three.js and Loaders:**
   - Ensure Three.js is included in your project, as mentioned in the previous steps.
   - You will also need to include loaders for the specific format you've exported your model in. For example, if you've exported a `.glTF` model, include `GLTFLoader`.

   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/loaders/GLTFLoader.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Load the Model:**
   - Use the appropriate loader to load your model into the scene.
   - For a `.glTF` model, you can do it like this:

   ```javascript
   const loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();
   loader.load('path/to/your/model.gltf', function(gltf) {
       scene.add(gltf.scene);
   }, undefined, function(error) {
       console.error(error);
   });
   ```

   Replace `'path/to/your/model.gltf'` with the actual path to your model file.

4. **Rendering and Animation:**
   - If your character model has animations, you can access and play them using the `mixer`:
   ```javascript
   let mixer;
   loader.load('path/to/your/model.gltf', function(gltf) {
       scene.add(gltf.scene);
       mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(gltf.scene);
       const action = mixer.clipAction(gltf.animations[0]);
       action.play();
   });
   ```

   - Update the mixer inside your render or animation loop:
   ```javascript
   const clock = new THREE.Clock();

   function animate() {
       requestAnimationFrame(animate);

       const delta = clock.getDelta();
       if (mixer) mixer.update(delta);

       renderer.render(scene, camera);
   }
   animate();
   ```

5. **Adjust Camera and Scene Settings:**
   - You might need to adjust the camera position and settings to properly frame your character.
   - Also, consider adding lights to the scene to properly illuminate the model.

6. **Testing:**
   - Make sure to test your webpage to ensure that the model loads and displays correctly.

Remember, loading and rendering 3D models can be complex, especially when dealing with animations and textures. It's important to refer to the Three.js documentation and examples for detailed guidance and troubleshooting.
