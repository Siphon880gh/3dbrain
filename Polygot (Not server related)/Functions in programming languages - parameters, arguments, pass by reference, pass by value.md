Arguments are passed by value; that is, when a function is called, the parameter receives a copy of the argument's value or its address. This rule applies to all scalar values, structures, and unions passed as arguments. In pass by value, modifying a parameter does not modify the corresponding argument passed by the function call. In pass by reference, modifying a parameter does modify the corresponding argument passed by the function call
