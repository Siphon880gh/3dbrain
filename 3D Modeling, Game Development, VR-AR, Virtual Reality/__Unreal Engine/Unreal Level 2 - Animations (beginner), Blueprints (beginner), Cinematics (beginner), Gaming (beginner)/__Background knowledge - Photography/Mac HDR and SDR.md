On Mac settings: "To increase batttery life, your Mac will stream high dynanic range (HDR) video in standard dynamic range (SDR)" Whats HDR and SDR? Is it the samething with cameras where you have lattitude of stops of details on shadows and lightings?

HDR (High Dynamic Range) and SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) are terms used in both video display and camera technology, but they refer to slightly different concepts in each context.

1. **HDR and SDR in Display Technology**:
   - **HDR**: High Dynamic Range in displays refers to the ability of a screen to display a wider range of colors, brighter whites, and deeper blacks. This results in an image that is more detailed and lifelike, particularly in areas of high contrast. HDR content is encoded with more data to provide this expanded range of brightness and color.
   - **SDR**: Standard Dynamic Range is the traditional range of color and brightness used in most displays and media for many years. It provides fewer details in highlights and shadows compared to HDR.

2. **HDR in Camera Technology**:
   - In the context of cameras, HDR refers to a technique that captures multiple photos at different exposure levels and then combines them into one image. This process increases the 'dynamic range' of the photograph, meaning it captures more details in the brightest and darkest parts of the image. It's similar to what HDR displays aim to achieve, but it's about capturing that range in an image rather than displaying it.

So, while the underlying principle of capturing or displaying a wider range of light and color information is the same, the implementation differs in displays and cameras. In your Mac's settings, the term HDR relates to the display technology and how it handles video content, offering more vibrant and detailed imagery when available, compared to SDR.
