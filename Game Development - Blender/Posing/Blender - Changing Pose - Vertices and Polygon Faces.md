If your model doesn’t have armature/bones/pose, but it has vertices and polygon faces, and you are changing its pose, this is the most involved when it comes to precisely clicking the right areas.

Use case:
**You have a FBX file from Sketch Fab, 3DFree, etc but the posture of the arms are wrong**
You want to pull the arms down to a more neutral standing position. Sure!

You will select all the vertices/polygon faces that need to be translated/rotated together

You can drag in the axes, zoom, and hand panning to orbit around the character

You have to make sure you don’t miss any vertices/polygon faces

You select an area of vertices/polygon faces with:
SHIFT+drag over area

But when you over selected vertices that shouldn’t be included:
Shift+click can deselect the particular vertex

Once the vertexes are selected, you can transform:

I missed a polygon on his left arm (off his wrist) - noo! lol
Exercise: What would you do in this case?
