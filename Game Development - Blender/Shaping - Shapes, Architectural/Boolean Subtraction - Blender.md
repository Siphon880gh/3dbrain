Make sure you have the "Object: Bool Tool" plugin enabled under Edit->Preferences->Add-ons. If you check its shortcuts, keep in mind that Bool Difference is Ctrl + Shift + Numpad Minus. If you just installed now, you have to restart Blender even if it didn't ask you to (else the cutting by Boolean Difference shortcut won't work).

In **Object Mode**, select your **Plane + Model**
**Shift+CTRL+Numpad Minus**
This only works if you had the "Object: Bool Tool" plugin enabled under Edit->Preferences->Add-ons
