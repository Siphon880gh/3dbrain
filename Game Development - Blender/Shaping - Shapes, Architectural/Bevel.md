Adding bevels to a shape is very involved in that there are different types of bevels:
- Bevel edge
	- Fillet
	- Chamfer
	- Bevel aka ramp
- Bevel vertexes
- Bevel face

## Bevel Edges 

Concept: Bevel and chamfer are usually used interchangeably unless you want to be technical about it: A bevel is actually a ramp and a chamfer is a partial ramp that makes up the edge.

Challenge: Make one of the edges a chamfer edge (technical word). Layperson word: have the edge beveled.

Select edge -> Bevel tool (CMD+B)
Not B because B is for Select Box

How it works. Tangent to the edge at 45 degrees will create two new 3d vertex points (as in, 2 vertex at end of edge and 2 more vertexes at the other end of edge) and it will subtract mesh from those two points

Industry: Chamfered edges have a variety of functions during the manufacturing process. They remove sharp edges from workpieces and, therefore, facilitate safe handling. Chamfering also aids in the assembly of parts and serves a cosmetic purpose by improving the look ofÂ **[machined parts](https://www.madearia.com/blog/cnc-machined-parts/)**. Chamfer mills and chamfer planes are some of the tools used to machine chamfers.

Challenge: Create a ramp out of a box. Technical word: Bevel.

Select edge -> Bevel Tool (CMD+B)
Go all the way until the two new 3d vertex points (as in, 2 vertex at end of edge and 2 more vertexes at the other end of edge) juxtapositions over the old vertexes.

Industry: Unlike a chamfered edge which covers a fraction of the plane between two parallel surfaces, a beveled edge runs for the entire length of the plane. Therefore, we take out more material to create beveled edges compared to chamfered edges.

Therefore bevel tool allows you to create a chamfer or a bevel/ramp depending on the extent you go with it

Extra Challenge: 
Chamfer all four corners

Hint: select all 4 edges -> CMD+B while in Edit mode -> Then drag to choose desired level of bevel/chamfer

## Bevel Vertexes

Instead of CMD+B, SHIFT+CMD+B will bevel the vertex

With edge selected in Edit Mode, SHIFT+CMD+**D**

## Fillet / Smooth out the bevel

While adding bevel, use mouse scroll before committing with a click:

Gone too far will make the cube a quarter with a fillet face

Also works on the vertex bevel mode (SHIFT+CMD+B):

## Face bevel

Face bevel is like a pull (from push/pull) with a fillet

You select the face, then CMD+B, then drag.

## Troubleshooting

Problem: Moues scroll doesnt cause a curving or filliting

You probably already commited the bevel change. Try to bevel again and before clicking the mouse, drag a bit to have new space to see the curve, THEN try the mouse scroll.

You'd try to bevel again using CMD+B or CMD+SHIFT+B, but NOT by using the bevel handle:
