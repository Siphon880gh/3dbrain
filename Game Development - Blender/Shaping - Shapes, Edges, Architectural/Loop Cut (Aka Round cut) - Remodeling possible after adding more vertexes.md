A loop cut are added vertexes around the model. Those vertexes connect as edges. The result is a loop of edges around the surface. By having more vertexes/edges, you have more points you can transform in order to remodel the shape or add complex sub-shapes.


Edit Mode -> CMD+R

Create a round of cuts that go around the mesh

You can cut in the other axis too:

Pressing SHIFT+R will add a loop cut evenly between two adjacent loop cuts

Shift+R only can be activated after a CMD+R or a previous successful SHIFT+R. 

Mnemonic: Shift+R adds a loop cut evenly rather than allowing you to freely add loop cut (CMD+R, then drag). Remember this as constrained/ordered like when you're transforming pixels while holding SHIFT in Photoshop.

Mnemonic: CMD+R, because the R stands for round edge. Another name is loop edge which emphasizes that we're making a loop around the model.
