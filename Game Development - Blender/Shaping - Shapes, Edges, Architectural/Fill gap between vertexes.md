Here we have three vertexes selected.
Press f for fill. 

That will bridge the vertexes FILLING IN mesh into a triangular face

## Rectangular face

With four vertexes selected, F will fill in a plane mesh

## Edge

With two vertexes selected, F will fill in an edge

## Create-and-connect way.

For even faster creation of edges and rectangles, especially if connects to a previous vertex or edge.

If you have a vertex or edge selected:

You can create another vertex with CTRL+RMB, and it'll fill in an edge right away (no need to press F)

Similarly can be done for rectangles, if you had an edge selected, then you create a new vertex with CTRL+RMB2
