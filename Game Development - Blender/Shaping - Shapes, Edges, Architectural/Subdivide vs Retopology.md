These are two distinct processes in 3D modeling that modify the number of polygons, each serving different purposes:

1. **Subdivision:**
   - **Purpose, Reworded**: Going from less vertexes to more vertexes
   - **Purpose:** Subdivision is used to increase the detail and smoothness of a mesh by adding more geometry. It's often used when you want to add detail to a model or when preparing a low-polygon model for high-resolution rendering.
   - **Process:** When you subdivide a mesh, Blender automatically adds more vertices, edges, and faces to the model. This can be done uniformly across the entire mesh or selectively on certain parts of the mesh. The Catmull-Clark subdivision surface modifier is a common way to apply smooth subdivision in Blender.
   - **Result:** The result is a higher-polygon model with more detail and smoother surfaces. However, it can also lead to a higher computational load, making the model more resource-intensive to work with.
   - **CAVEAT**: Subdivision is NOT the same as subdivision surface

2. **Retopology:**
   - **Purpose, Reworded**: Going from more vertexes to less vertexes
   - **Purpose:** Retopology is the process of creating a new, more efficient topology for a 3D model. It's often used after sculpting or when you have a model with a messy or overly complex wireframe. The goal is to create a mesh with a clean, organized flow of polygons, which is easier to animate, texture, and manage.
   - **Process:** This involves manually creating a new mesh over the existing one. The new mesh typically has fewer polygons and is organized in a way that follows the natural lines and features of the model. Tools like snapping, shrinkwrap modifiers, and specialized retopology software are often used.
   - **Result:** The outcome is a mesh with a cleaner, more efficient topology. This new topology is usually better for animation and other operations, as it has fewer polygons and a more logical structure. It also makes UV mapping and texturing easier and more effective.

In summary, while subdivision adds complexity to a model by increasing its polygon count, retopology simplifies and reorganizes a model's topology for better efficiency and usability in animation and rendering.

Subdividing in Blender is a way to increase the number of vertices, edges, and faces in a mesh, which can be useful for creating more detailed models. Here's a basic guide on how to subdivide a mesh in Blender:

1. **Open Blender and Select Your Object**: Make sure you have the object you want to subdivide selected.

2. **Enter Edit Mode**: You can do this by pressing `Tab` or by selecting 'Edit Mode' from the mode menu at the bottom of the 3D viewport.

3. **Select What to Subdivide**: 
    - If you want to subdivide the entire mesh, press `A` to select all.
    - If you only want to subdivide a part of the mesh, select the vertices, edges, or faces you want to subdivide.

4. **Subdivide the Mesh**: 
    - Go to the Mesh menu in the 3D viewport header, then select 'Subdivide'. 
    - Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Right-Click` in the 3D Viewport (if using Blender's right-click select option) or `Ctrl + R` to subdivide.

5. **Adjust the Subdivision Level**: 
    - After subdividing, an options panel will appear in the bottom left corner of the 3D viewport.
    - You can adjust the number of cuts, the smoothness, and other options to control how the mesh is subdivided.

6. **Apply Additional Modifications (Optional)**:
    - You can use other tools like 'Smooth', 'Extrude', 'Bevel', etc., to further modify your mesh.

7. **Exit Edit Mode**: Once you're done, you can exit Edit Mode by pressing `Tab` again or selecting 'Object Mode' from the mode menu.

Remember, subdividing increases the polygon count of your model, which can make it more resource-intensive to render. Use it judiciously to maintain a balance between detail and performance.

Retopology in Blender involves creating a new, more efficient topology for a 3D model, which is especially useful after sculpting or when dealing with a mesh that has a complex or disorganized structure. Here’s a basic guide to perform retopology in Blender:

1. **Prepare Your High-Poly Model:**
    
    - Import or select the high-poly model you want to retopologize.
    - Ensure it's visible in the viewport.
      
2. **Add a New Mesh for Retopology:**
    
    - Create a new mesh (like a plane) that you will use to build the new topology.
    - Position it close to the surface of your high-poly model.
      
3. **Snap to Surface:**
    
    - Enable snapping (`Shift + Tab`) and set it to 'Face' mode. This makes the vertices of your new mesh snap to the surface of the high-poly model.
    - Ensure 'Project Individual Elements' and 'On the Surface' are checked.
      
4. **Shrinkwrap Modifier (Optional):**
    
    - You can add a Shrinkwrap modifier to your new mesh to make it cling to the surface of the high-poly model. Set the target to your high-poly model.
      
5. **Start Retopologizing:**
    
    - Enter Edit Mode (`Tab`) on your new mesh.
    - Start extruding (`E`) vertices, edges, or faces to follow the contours of your high-poly model.
    - Focus on creating a topology that follows the natural flow of the model’s surface with quads (four-sided polygons) as much as possible.
      
6. **Use the F2 Add-On (Optional):**
    
    - Blender has an add-on called F2, which can speed up the retopology process. It allows for quick filling of faces and adjusting vertices.
      
7. **Adjust and Refine:**
    
    - Use tools like Grab (`G`), Loop Cut (`Ctrl + R`), and Knife (`K`) to adjust and refine the topology.
    - Continuously rotate your view to ensure the new topology conforms well to the high-poly model.
      
8. **Check the Topology:**
    
    - Periodically turn off the visibility of the high-poly model to check the topology of your new mesh.
    - Ensure there are no unnecessary polygons and that the flow of edges supports the form and any future animations.
      
9. **Finalize:**
    
    - Once you are satisfied with the retopology, you can apply the Shrinkwrap modifier if you used it.
    - Your retopologized mesh is now ready for further steps like UV mapping, texturing, rigging, or animation.

Retopology can be a time-consuming process, but it’s essential for creating a clean, efficient, and animation-friendly model. Blender also supports various add-ons and tools that can streamline the retopology process.
