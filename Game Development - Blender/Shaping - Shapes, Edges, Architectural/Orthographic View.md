Perspective vs Orthographic View
Our eyes are used to perspective viewing where distant objects appear smaller. Orthographic projection often seems a bit odd at first, because objects stay the same size regardless of their distance. It is like viewing the scene from an infinitely distant point. Nevertheless, orthographic viewing can be very useful, because it provides a more “technical” insight into the scene, making it easier to model and judge proportions.
