Say your model has multiple objects. You can go in Object Mode, select that part, then
**g then x** then click and drag, to move the object in the X axis

Your possibilities for moving are:
g (free flow drag anywhere)
g then x
g then y
g then z

Hot tip: G means grab/move.


---

Your possibilities for rotating are:
r (free flow drag anywhere)
r then x
r then y
x then z

---

Your possibilities for resizing are:
s (free flow drag anywhere)
s then x
s then y
s then z


---

If your model does not have separate parts, but let's say it's a character, and you want to manipulate the position of the character's arm, you'd have to select all the polygon faces pertaining to the arm. Refer to [[Blender - Changing Pose - Vertices and Polygon Faces]]
