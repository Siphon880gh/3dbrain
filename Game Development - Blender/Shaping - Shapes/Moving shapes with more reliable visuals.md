Moving a 3d object in 3d space will not look like where you think you placed it much of the time.

Recommend moving the object locked to one of the axis (G,X/Y/Z), then orbit the viewport to confirm is in placement on the axis (Scroll mouse).

You might have the wrong axis. You can switch to another axis right away. Eg. G->X->Y

Repeat for the other two axes as appropriate.
