Remember, `.gitignore` only ignores untracked files/folders. If the folder has been previously committed, you need to remove it using something like:
```
git rm -r --cached "**/Private/**"
```

---

To remove all subfolders from Private:
`git rm -r --cached "**/Private/**"`

To remove all folders named "Private - Joe", "Private - John"
```
git rm -r --cached "**/Private/**"
```

---


- If you just want to remove a file from being tracked in future commits but don't care about its history, `git rm --cached` is sufficient (clearing the cache aka staging area).


For example:
```
git rm --cached "**/.DS_Store"
```

    
- If you want to purge a file completely from the entire history of the repository, then you'll need to use tools like `git filter-repo` or `git filter-branch`.


For example:
```
git filter-repo --path quizer-temporal-fx-381723.json --invert-paths
```


Remember, rewriting history (as with `filter-repo` or `filter-branch`) can be problematic in shared repositories since other collaborators will have a history that conflicts with the rewritten one. Always communicate and coordinate with collaborators when taking such actions.
