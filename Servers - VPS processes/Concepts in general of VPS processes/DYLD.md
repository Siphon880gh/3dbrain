DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable on macOS that specifies a list of directories where the dynamic linker should look for dynamic libraries (dylibs) before it looks in the default locations. Essentially, it's a way to tell your system where to find the shared libraries that executable programs need to load at runtime.
When a program starts, it may require certain shared libraries (.dylib files on macOS) to be present so it can use the functionality they provide. By default, the system knows to look in standard locations like /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib. However, if you have libraries installed in non-standard locations (which can often happen with user-installed packages), the dynamic linker might not find them.
Setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH allows you to add additional directories to the search path. For example:



DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
