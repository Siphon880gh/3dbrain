The Apple M1 Pro chipset is a very capable chip, and its GPU with 16 cores should offer good performance for many tasks in Unreal Engine. Your Mac also meets the minimum RAM requirement for Unreal Engine, which is 8 GB, with 16 GB being the recommended amount for comfortable development.

Here are a few things to consider with your setup:

1. **RAM**: 16GB of RAM is sufficient for most Unreal Engine projects, particularly if you're not working on extremely large or asset-heavy projects.

2. **GPU Cores**: With 16 GPU cores, the M1 Pro should handle Unreal Engine's graphics demands quite well for most development tasks.

3. **Metal Support**: Metal 3 is Apple's latest graphics API, offering optimized performance for games and applications. Unreal Engine's support for Metal means it can leverage this for improved graphics performance on macOS.

4. **Display**: You have a high-resolution built-in display and an additional 1080p monitor. High-resolution displays may affect the performance in Unreal Engine, as they require more power to render the editor interface and the game viewport. You might see improved performance by using the external monitor as your main display when working in Unreal Engine or reducing the resolution of your MacBook's display while using the engine.

While the M1 Pro is powerful, there are a few limitations to keep in mind:

- **Compatibility**: Make sure you are using the version of Unreal Engine that supports Apple Silicon. As of my last update, Unreal Engine 4.27 and later had begun adding support for Apple Silicon Macs, and this was expected to continue improving.

- **Thermal Management**: Although the M1 Pro is designed with efficiency in mind, prolonged heavy use like game development can push its thermal envelope, potentially leading to throttling. Ensure your MacBook has adequate ventilation.

- **Storage**: SSD speed and capacity can also affect performance, especially when compiling shaders and building lighting. Ensure you have enough fast SSD storage available for your project.

- **Plugins and Tools**: Some third-party plugins and tools may not yet be optimized for the M1 architecture. You may need to verify the compatibility of any additional tools you plan to use.

In summary, your Mac should be quite capable of running Unreal Engine for a wide range of development tasks. If you encounter performance issues, they may be mitigated through project optimization, engine settings adjustments, and ensuring you're running the latest version of Unreal that supports Apple Silicon.
