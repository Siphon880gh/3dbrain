Unreal doesnt support mp3. You have to convert to wav. You can google for various online tools that convert mp3 to wav. If you like terminal, you can run `ffmpeg -i source.mp3 converted.wav`

Bad UX: Btw, it wont complain if you import a MP3. It just won’t play. (Bad UX)

You should have noticed in the import dialog that mp3 is not listed in the filter you will probably have to convert your audio files to another format first (mp4, wav, wmv). If you don’t have a software installed you could use a online converter like online-convert.com 1.1k to at least test it.
