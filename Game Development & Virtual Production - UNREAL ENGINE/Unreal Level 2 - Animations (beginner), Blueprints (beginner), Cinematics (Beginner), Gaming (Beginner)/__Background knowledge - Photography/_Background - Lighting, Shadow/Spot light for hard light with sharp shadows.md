In photography and cinematography, a spotlight is generally considered a source of hard light. The defining characteristics of hard light are sharp shadows with clear, well-defined edges, and a spotlight typically creates this kind of shadow.

The hardness or softness of light is determined by the size of the light source relative to the subject: the larger the source, the softer the light. A spotlight, despite its intensity, is usually a relatively small light source, especially when it's placed at a distance from the subject. This small size in relation to the subject causes the light to cast sharp shadows, making it a hard light source.

To soften the light from a spotlight, diffusers or bounce materials are often used. These materials spread the light out, effectively increasing the size of the light source and thereby softening the light and the shadows it casts.
