Three point light system

Edge light
Light behind the subject to create a white line on one side of the body. Likely showing up as a lit/white edge of a side of the face.

Key light
Light to shine the subject so can be seen

Main light
Light likely above the subject to imitate natural sunlight or sunlight going into indoors (so it’s not a pitch black room)



Fill light
Indirect fill light: Light bouncing off of white wall, hitting the subject’s one side
Direct fill light: Towel covering a light source. That light hits the surface softly
Usually you have a fill light one side of the subject

Negative fill
Using a black wall on one side of the subject so the subject has a dark side.


Light travels infinitely but what we can see on the visible spectrum is different.

Intensity will increase the distance of the visible light we can see 

Rect light / softbox size does not affect distance of the visible light. It just affects the area that gets lit. For example, a small softlight onto a wall versus a large softlight onto a wall.

In the three-point lighting system, the edge light, also known as the backlight or rim light, is typically a hard light. This kind of light is used to create a distinct outline or rim of light around the subject, helping to separate them from the background and adding depth to the image.

The hard quality of the edge light creates a sharp contrast between the lit and unlit areas, accentuating the edges of the subject. This is different from a soft light, which produces a more diffused, gentle illumination with softer shadows and a less pronounced distinction between light and dark areas. The three-point lighting system typically consists of three main lights:

1. **Key Light:** The main source of light, usually placed to one side of the camera/subject, creating shadows on the opposite side of the subject's face or object.

2. **Fill Light:** Used to fill in the shadows created by the key light, placed on the opposite side of the key light. It's usually softer and less intense than the key light.

3. **Backlight (Edge Light):** Placed behind the subject, this light creates a rim of light around the subject, enhancing the three-dimensional look.

Each of these lights serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall balance and depth of the scene. The edge light's hard quality is essential for achieving the desired effect of separation and dimensionality in this lighting setup.

But you can choose not to use key light as the key light. You can use edge light as the key light! Also, you can mix two lights and change its role. There are advanced lighting applications.
