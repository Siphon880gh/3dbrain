Why is there max min settings for focal length and aperture?

| **Current Focal Length** | The focal length property of the camera, which is limited based on the focal length range defined by the **Min/Max Focal Length** properties in **Lens Settings**. |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Current Aperture** | The aperture or **FStop** property of the camera, which is limited based on the FStop range defined by the **Min/Max FStop** properties in **Lens Settings**. |

When you move your mouse over the Current Focal Length or Current Aperture, there’s a slide icon that appears that lets you click and drag left and right. Letting you cap the min and max is so that you can later adjust using the sliders between two expected looks.
