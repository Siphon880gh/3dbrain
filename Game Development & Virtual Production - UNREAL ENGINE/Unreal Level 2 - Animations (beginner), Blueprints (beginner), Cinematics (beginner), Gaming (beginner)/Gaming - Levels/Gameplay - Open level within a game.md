If you do not know how to do overlap events, refer to [[Location based triggers aka collision overlaps]]

Remember to have the Exit cube as a Blueprint. You can convert into Blueprint

At the Blueprint, you have an Open Level node

You can easily find the name of the other level by going to File -> Open Level
Then browse there for the name (You can temporarily rename for the name to Copy and Paste):
