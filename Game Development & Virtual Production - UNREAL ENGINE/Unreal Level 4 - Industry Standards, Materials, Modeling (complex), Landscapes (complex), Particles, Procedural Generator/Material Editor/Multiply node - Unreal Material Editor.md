## Multiple Uses

In a material editor, typically found in 3D graphics software and game engines, the "Multiply" operation is used to combine two textures or values by multiplying them together. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

1. **Texture Combination**: When used with textures, Multiply blends two textures by multiplying the color values of each pixel from one texture with the corresponding pixel from the other. This results in darker colors since multiplying colors together (which are represented as values between 0 and 1) decreases the overall value. It's often used to add shadows or dirt maps over a base texture.

2. **Color Manipulation**: If you multiply a texture by a solid color, it scales the brightness of each pixel by the color values. For instance, multiplying by a grey color darkens the texture, while multiplying by a colored tint adds that color to the texture.

3. **Material Properties**: In the context of materials, Multiply can be used to modulate properties like specular intensity, roughness, or ambient occlusion, by multiplying these values with a texture or a constant value.

4. **Lighting Effects**: It's also used in lighting calculations. For instance, the diffuse part of the lighting is often obtained by multiplying the light's color with the texture color of the material.

The Multiply operation is a fundamental and versatile tool in material creation, allowing for a range of effects from subtle texture variation to significant changes in the appearance of a material.

## Example (Use Case)

When changing the emission of an item (eg. adding glow to Text Render), your constant3vector will receive rgb for the color, but if you had multiplied that to a number, you can affect the glow spread:

## Examples (Generic)

The "Multiply" operation in material editing or any context that involves numerical calculations is quite straightforward. It involves multiplying corresponding values together. Here are some examples using numbers:

1. **Texture Color Multiplication**:
    
    - Let's say we have a pixel in Texture A with a color value represented in RGB as (0.2, 0.5, 0.7) and a corresponding pixel in Texture B with a color value of (0.5, 0.6, 0.3).
    - The result of multiplying these together would be:
        - Red channel: 0.2×0.5=0.10.2×0.5=0.1
        - Green channel: 0.5×0.6=0.30.5×0.6=0.3
        - Blue channel: 0.7×0.3=0.210.7×0.3=0.21
    - So, the resulting color would be (0.1, 0.3, 0.21).
2. **Multiplying with a Constant Value**:
    
    - Suppose you have a texture color (0.8, 0.4, 0.2) and you multiply it by a constant value of 0.5.
    - The result would be:
        - Red channel: 0.8×0.5=0.40.8×0.5=0.4
        - Green channel: 0.4×0.5=0.20.4×0.5=0.2
        - Blue channel: 0.2×0.5=0.10.2×0.5=0.1
    - So, the resulting color would be (0.4, 0.2, 0.1).
3. **Material Property Adjustment**:
    
    - If

the specular intensity of a material is 0.7 and you multiply it by a texture value of 0.6, the resulting specular intensity becomes:

- 0.7×0.6=0.420.7×0.6=0.42
- This means the specular reflection is now at 42% of its original intensity.

These examples illustrate how the Multiply operation is used to blend and modify textures and properties in a material editor. It's a straightforward but powerful tool for achieving various visual effects and adjustments.
