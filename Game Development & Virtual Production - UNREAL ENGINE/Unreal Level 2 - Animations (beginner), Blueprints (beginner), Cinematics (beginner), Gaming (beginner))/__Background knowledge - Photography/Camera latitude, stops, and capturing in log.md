## Latitude, Stops

In photography and videography, "latitude" refers to the dynamic range of a camera, or the range of luminance it can capture while still retaining detail in both the darkest and brightest areas. A camera with high latitude can handle a wide range of lighting conditions and capture more details in shadows and highlights.

In the context of camera latitude and dynamic range, the "stops" of light, each of which doubles or halves the amount of light captured. When someone mentions a camera having 12 stops of dynamic range (latitude) versus 6 stops, it means the camera can handle a much wider range of brightness levels.

A camera with 12 stops of dynamic range can capture more details in both the darkest and brightest parts of the image without losing information. This is particularly beneficial in challenging lighting conditions. Conversely, a camera with only 6 stops of dynamic range will struggle more with high contrast scenes and may lose detail in shadows or highlights more quickly.

If your camera has a low latitude or a limited number of stops of dynamic range, it will struggle to capture both the well-lit subject and the dimly lit background in the same shot. In the scenario you've described, where the subject on the porch is well-lit but the background is dim due to the setting sun, a camera with low latitude will likely capture the subject properly but render the background very dark or even completely black. This happens because the camera can't accommodate the high contrast between the bright and dark areas within its limited dynamic range. You'd have to choose between properly exposing for the subject or the background, but not both simultaneously.

## Bringing it back to Unreal

In Unreal Engine, emulating dynamic range, particularly for creating realistic lighting and shadow effects, is often done through a combination of techniques and settings that adjust how light and darkness are portrayed in the scene. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **HDR (High Dynamic Range) Rendering:**
   - Unreal Engine supports HDR rendering, which allows for a broader range of light intensities in the scene. Ensure that your project is set up for HDR to make the most out of the engine's capabilities.

2. **Exposure Settings:**
   - **Auto Exposure (Eye Adaptation):** This simulates how the human eye adjusts when moving between bright and dark areas. It can be adjusted in the Post Process Volume under the Exposure settings. Tweak parameters like "Min Brightness," "Max Brightness," and "Exposure Compensation" to get the desired dynamic range effect.
   - **Manual Exposure:** If you want consistent lighting without the automatic adjustments, you can opt for manual exposure settings, giving you direct control over the scene's brightness.

3. **Lighting Quality and Types:**
   - Utilize various light types (Directional, Point, Spot, and Sky Lights) and their settings to create depth and contrast in your scene. High-quality light settings can simulate realistic interactions between light and objects.
   - **IES Profiles:** Import IES profiles for your lights to emulate real-world lighting conditions and intensities.

4. **Post Process Volume:**
   - This is a powerful tool in Unreal Engine that allows you to adjust various aspects of how your scene is rendered, including color grading, bloom, and shadows. Tweaking these settings can help you achieve a more realistic dynamic range.
   - **Bloom:** Simulates how real-world cameras handle extremely bright light, contributing to the sense of high dynamic range.
   - **Contrast and Saturation:** Adjust these to enhance or reduce the intensity and depth of your colors and shadows.

5. **Ray Tracing and Global Illumination:**
   - If you're using a version of Unreal Engine that supports it, enabling Ray Tracing can significantly enhance the realism of your lighting, shadows, and reflections, contributing to a more dynamic and realistic range of light.
   - Global Illumination (GI) techniques like Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI) or Ray Traced Global Illumination (RTGI) help simulate how light bounces off surfaces, filling in shadows and contributing to a more nuanced lighting environment.

6. **Use HDR Textures and Materials:**
   - Utilize or create HDR textures and materials that contain a higher range of light and color data. This ensures that your assets themselves can reflect a broader range of light intensities.

Remember that achieving a realistic dynamic range is often about balancing these elements to suit your particular scene and artistic vision. Experiment with different settings, and consider the performance implications, especially if you're targeting real-time applications or games.

## Capturing in log

When someone says they "shot the photo in log," they're referring to a logarithmic mode of recording. Log recording captures a flat, desaturated image that preserves more details in the highlights and shadows, effectively increasing the dynamic range. This is especially useful in high-contrast scenes. The flat image looks dull and desaturated straight out of the camera but provides more flexibility for color grading in post-production, allowing for a more detailed and dynamic final image.

## Why log sacrifices saturation for dynamic range

When you shoot in log (logarithmic) format, the image appears more desaturated and flat, but this isn't directly because saturation interferes with capturing highlights and shadows. Instead, this is an intentional design of the log format to maximize the dynamic range and detail captured in those highlights and shadows. Here's how it works and why saturation appears reduced:

1. **Dynamic Range Over Saturation:**
   - Log formats prioritize dynamic range over color saturation. By compressing the brighter parts of the image and lifting the darker parts into a flatter, more even distribution of tones, log formats can record a wider range of luminance levels. This process naturally makes the image look washed out or desaturated because the intense colors are subdued to fit within this extended range.

2. **Linear vs. Logarithmic Scaling:**
   - Standard video or image formats often use a linear scale, which allocates more data to the mid-tones and less to the extreme highlights and shadows. This can lead to clipping in bright areas and loss of detail in shadows.
   - Log formats use a logarithmic scale, which allocates more data to the highlights and shadows, preserving details that would otherwise be lost. However, this redistribution of data makes the image appear flatter and less vibrant.

3. **Saturation and Clipping:**
   - In a standard color space, highly saturated areas, especially in the highlights, can clip more easily because the color values exceed the maximum recordable intensity. This results in loss of detail.
   - In log format, by reducing the saturation and spreading out the luminance values, there's less chance of any particular color channel clipping. This preserves more detail across the entire image.

4. **Color Grading in Post-Production:**
   - The desaturated, flat look of log footage is not meant to be the final look. Instead, it's a starting point that gives colorists more control in post-production. Because the log format has preserved details in the highlights and shadows, and hasn't 'baked in' intense colors, the colorist can make more nuanced adjustments to both the color and luminance values.
   - When color grading log footage, the colorist can add saturation back into the image, adjusting it precisely to achieve the desired look without losing detail in the highlights and shadows.

In summary, while shooting in log doesn't imply that saturation inherently gets in the way of capturing highlights and shadows, the desaturated appearance is a byproduct of how log formats prioritize and redistribute luminance data to preserve detail. The ultimate goal is to provide more flexibility in post-production for achieving both the desired color and dynamic range in the final image.

## More Stops in Log Profile

In practical terms, more stops of dynamic range provide greater flexibility in post-production, especially when the footage is shot in a log profile, allowing for more intensive color grading and exposure adjustments without degrading image quality.

## LUTS and Dynamic Range

Having more dynamic range is generally beneficial when you're planning to use LUTs (Look-Up Tables) in post-production. Here's why:

1. **Greater Flexibility:** LUTs are used to map specific color values to other values, essentially applying a preset color grade to your footage. If your original footage has a wide dynamic range, the LUT has more information to work with. This means it can more effectively apply complex color grades without losing details in the highlights and shadows.

2. **Preservation of Details:** Shooting with a higher dynamic range, especially in log format, ensures that details in the brightest and darkest parts of the image are retained. When you apply a LUT to footage with a wide dynamic range, you're less likely to encounter clipping or crushing in these areas, leading to a more natural and appealing result.

3. **Enhanced Post-Production Control:** With more dynamic range, you have greater latitude in post-production to adjust exposure, contrast, and color balance before applying the LUT. This control allows you to fine-tune how the LUT affects your footage, ensuring the final image aligns with your creative vision.

4. **Reduced Banding and Artifacts:** Applying LUTs to footage with limited dynamic range can sometimes lead to banding or artifacts, especially in gradient areas like skies. More dynamic range means smoother gradients and a higher quality result after the LUT is applied.

5. **Better End Results:** Ultimately, LUTs can only enhance what's already there in the footage. If the original image lacks detail or has clipped highlights and crushed shadows, a LUT won't be able to recover that information. More dynamic range means a higher quality starting point, which leads to a better end result after the LUT is applied.

In summary, while you can apply LUTs to any footage, shooting with a camera that provides a higher dynamic range, and using a format like log that takes full advantage of this range, will give you the best results when it's time to apply LUTs and finalize your look in post-production.

**Reminder:** Your Unreal Engine's cine camera actor has a LUT property where you can select a LUT file (.tga, .png, etc)
