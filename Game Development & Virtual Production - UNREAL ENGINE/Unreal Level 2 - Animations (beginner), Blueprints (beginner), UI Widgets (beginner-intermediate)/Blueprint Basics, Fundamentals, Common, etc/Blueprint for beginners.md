Any object can be transformed into a Blue Print. Blue Print can be edited where there's a Viewport tab and an Event Graph. At the Event Graph, you have the node system

You will be creating nodes that affect the event, if/then, input transformation, and subject, linking nodes to each other.

You can comment multiple nodes by selecting multiple nodes with SHIFT+Click, then right click â†’ Create Comment from Selection
