In Unreal Engine, pressing `Shift + F1` is commonly used to release the mouse cursor from the game window during play in the editor. This is particularly useful when you're testing a game and need to interact with the editor or other applications without stopping the game. Here's how it works:

1. **Freeing the Mouse Cursor**: When you play a game in the Unreal Engine editor, your mouse cursor is typically captured and locked to the game window, especially in full-screen mode or when the game requires mouse input. Pressing `Shift + F1` releases the mouse cursor, allowing you to move it outside of the game window.
    
2. **Interacting with the Editor or Other Applications**: Once the cursor is freed, you can interact with the Unreal Editor's interface, other applications, or your desktop without having to stop the game.
    
3. **Returning to Game Control**: To regain control in the game window, you simply click back into the game window. This recaptures the mouse cursor, allowing you to continue interacting with the game.
