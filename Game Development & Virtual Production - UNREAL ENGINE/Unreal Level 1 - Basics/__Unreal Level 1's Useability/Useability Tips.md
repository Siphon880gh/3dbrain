**Two monitors?**
With two monitors, you can have one monitor on the level designer and a second monitor on the camera preview at the same time
On monitor 1, make sure your main editor is opened. Check that the top-left dropdown that includes Perspective has checkmarked “Default”
Open a new viewport by going to Windows → Viewports → Viewport 2
Drag the new viewport to monitor 2. Inside monitor 2 view port, select the camera of interest. Right-click → Pilot...

**Common problem**: *Camera preview pop-in being annoying* when you click a camera
You may want to disable the camera preview that appears when clicking the camera -OR- resize it to be smaller because it obstructs your view:
UnrealEditor → Preferences → Search: Camera Preview

CMD+` on mac to switch between windows


**QBridge Favorites** - Should favorite items so you can easily go back to it (As of 2023 Q3, there is no “downloaded” view)
