What affects exposure:
- Shutter Speed
- ISO
- Aperture

Shutter speed in photography is one of the key factors that affect exposure, alongside aperture and ISO. Exposure refers to the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor. Shutter speed dictates how long the camera's shutter is open to expose the sensor to light. A faster shutter speed (like 1/1000th of a second) lets in less light, leading to a darker image, and is used to freeze motion. A slower shutter speed (like 1 second) allows more light in, resulting in a brighter image and can capture motion blur. Balancing shutter speed with aperture and ISO is crucial for achieving the desired exposure in your photographs.

Summary:
- The slower, the more light comes in (exposure)
- The faster, the less light comes in (exposure)

Aperture is one of the three primary components of the exposure triangle in photography, alongside shutter speed and ISO. It plays a critical role in determining exposure, which is the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor or film. Here's how aperture affects exposure:

1. **Aperture Size:** Aperture refers to the size of the opening in the lens through which light passes. It's measured in f-stops (e.g., f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6). A lower f-stop number means a larger aperture, and a higher f-stop number indicates a smaller aperture.
    
2. **Amount of Light:** A larger aperture (lower f-stop number) allows more light to pass through the lens and onto the camera's sensor, leading to a brighter image. Conversely, a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) permits less light, resulting in a darker image.
    
3. **Exposure Adjustments:** When you adjust the aperture, you are essentially controlling the intensity of light that the sensor is exposed to. If you're in a brightly lit environment, a smaller aperture helps prevent overexposure. In dimmer settings, a larger aperture can help you capture a brighter image without having to adjust the ISO or shutter speed.
    
4. **Depth of Field:** Besides exposure, aperture also affects the depth of field in an image. A larger aperture (small f-stop number) results in a shallow depth of field, meaning only a small portion of the image will be in focus while the background is blurred. A smaller aperture (large f-stop number) increases the depth of field, making more of the scene in focus.

Aperture is the other primary component that affects exposure.
  
ISO stands for "International Organization for Standardization," which is the body that standardizes sensitivity ratings for camera sensors.

You can set the ISO setting on your camera. Most digital cameras, including DSLRs, mirrorless cameras, and even many smartphone cameras, allow you to adjust the ISO. This setting is typically found in the camera's menu or directly accessible via a dedicated ISO button or dial. Adjusting the ISO allows you to control the sensor's sensitivity to light, which is essential for getting the right exposure in your photographs under varying lighting conditions. Remember to balance the ISO with other settings like aperture and shutter speed to achieve the desired photographic outcome.

To adjust the ISO on your iPhone camera, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Open the Camera App:** Start by opening the Camera app on your iPhone.
2. **Focus on the Subject:** Tap on the screen to set the focus on your subject. A yellow square will indicate your focus point.
3. **Adjust Exposure (which indirectly affects ISO):** After setting the focus, you can adjust the exposure by swiping up or down on the screen. Swiping up increases the brightness (higher exposure), and swiping down decreases it (lower exposure). The iPhone automatically adjusts the ISO based on the exposure you set.

It's important to note that manually controlling ISO directly is not a standard feature in the iPhone's built-in Camera app. However, if you require more precise control over the ISO setting, you can use third-party camera apps that offer manual control over ISO, such as Camera+ 2. These apps provide advanced camera controls, including the ability to adjust ISO settings manually.

Remember, adjusting ISO is a matter of balancing the right amount of light for your photo. In well-lit environments, a lower ISO is generally better, whereas in low-light conditions, a higher ISO may be necessary. However, higher ISO settings can introduce noise or graininess in the photo.
