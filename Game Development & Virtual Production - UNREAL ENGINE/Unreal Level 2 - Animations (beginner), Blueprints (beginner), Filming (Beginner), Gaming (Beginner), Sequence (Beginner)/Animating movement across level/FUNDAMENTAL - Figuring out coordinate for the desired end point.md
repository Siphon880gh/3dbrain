You can duplicate the object you want to move across the map (OPT+SHIFT+Drag on a moving vector)

Move the second copy into the spot you desired it would have moved to. You can also rotate or resize it to the desired end appearance if applicable.

Go into your blueprint event graph where you have the position values in either a lerp node or at one of the timeline tracks. Copy the values from the level editor to the values (Preferablly you would have two monitors)

Once done, erase the second copy off the level editor.
