AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance vs ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster with EC2 containers involve different levels of abstraction and serve different purposes in the AWS ecosystem. 

How to access:
- AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance
	- Services -> Compute -> EC2

- ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster with EC2 containers
	- Services -> Containers -> Elastic Container Service
	- https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2/home?region=us-east-2

Here's a breakdown to help you understand the differences:

### AWS EC2 Instance Template from EC2 Dashboard

- **Purpose**: An EC2 instance template is primarily used to create individual virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. These instances can be used for a wide range of computing tasks, from hosting web applications to running large-scale data processing.
- **Customization and Control**: When you create an instance through the EC2 dashboard, you have the ability to customize nearly every aspect of the VM, including the instance type (which determines CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity), the operating system, storage options, networking settings, security groups, IAM roles, and more.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for situations where you need full control over the virtual environment and wish to manage the operating system and software stack directly.

### ECS Cluster with EC2 Instances

- **Purpose**: ECS is a container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. When using the EC2 launch type within ECS, your containers are run on a cluster of EC2 instances managed by ECS.
- **Abstraction Level**: ECS abstracts the underlying infrastructure management tasks (like scaling, placement, and health monitoring of containers) while still allowing you to use EC2 instances to host your containers. This means you don't manage the instances directly in the same way as you do with individual EC2 instances; instead, you define tasks and services that describe your container configurations, and ECS handles the placement and management.
- **Customization and Control**: While you still can choose the instance types and the number of instances in your ECS cluster, the focus shifts towards the container management aspects. ECS decides on which specific instance within the cluster your container will run, based on the requirements you define (CPU, memory, ports, etc.).
- **Use Case**: Ideal for microservices architecture and applications that are designed to run in containers. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scalability of containerized applications.

### Comparison and Context

- **Level of Abstraction**: Direct management of EC2 instances gives you granular control over the computing environment, suitable for traditional application deployments. ECS with EC2 instances abstracts some of the infrastructure management to focus more on container orchestration and scalability.
- **Management Overhead**: Managing individual EC2 instances requires more effort in terms of setup, scaling, and maintenance, especially for complex applications. ECS reduces this overhead by handling the orchestration of containers, making it easier to scale and manage applications composed of multiple containers.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: ECS on EC2 instances provides built-in features for easy scaling of containerized applications, including dynamic scaling based on demand. Direct EC2 instances may require additional tools (like Auto Scaling Groups) for similar scalability.

In summary, the choice between using direct EC2 instances and ECS clusters with EC2 launch type depends on your specific application requirements, the level of control and abstraction you need, and how you prefer to manage your infrastructure.

## EC2 without ECS - Why EC2 itself may not be enough

Without using ECS, an influx of too many users could potentially lead to the website becoming overwhelmed and crashing, especially if it becomes stuck processing a Flask request. Employing Supervisor and Gunicorn, however, allows for the distribution of the workload across multiple worker processes, thereby enabling the handling of concurrent requests efficiently. Eventually, reaching the memory capacity of the server will necessitate the deployment of additional containers to accommodate the increased load. Kubernetes facilitates this process by deploying Docker images across more servers, ensuring scalable and efficient application performance.

Reworded: When hosting a Flask application (or any web application) on an AWS EC2 instance without using a container orchestration service like ECS (Elastic Container Service) or a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes, managing the load effectively becomes crucial, especially as user traffic increases. Let's break down your concerns and how Supervisor with Gunicorn - and - Docker Kubernetes can address them:

### Flask Application Without Concurrency Management

- A bare Flask server is a synchronous server, and by default, it can only handle one request at a time per process. This means if you have a long-running request, other requests will have to wait until the current one is completed, which could lead to performance issues and potential downtime if the server is overwhelmed with requests.

### Using Supervisor and Gunicorn

- **Gunicorn**: It's a pre-fork worker model server for running Python web applications. Gunicorn can spawn multiple worker processes to handle requests concurrently. This means that if one request is taking a long time, other requests can still be processed in parallel by other workers, significantly improving the ability to handle more traffic and preventing a single request from blocking others.
  
- **Supervisor**: This tool can monitor and control numerous processes, including Gunicorn. It ensures that your Gunicorn workers are always running. If a worker process crashes, Supervisor can automatically restart it, enhancing the reliability and uptime of your application.

### Scaling Beyond a Single Instance

- As you correctly noted, even with Supervisor and Gunicorn managing your application's processes, there's a physical limit to how much traffic a single EC2 instance can handle, determined by the instance's CPU, memory, and network capacity. Once you approach these limits, you'll experience degraded performance, potentially leading to application crashes if the memory is exhausted.
  
- **Scaling Out**: At this point, scaling out (horizontal scaling) becomes necessary. This involves deploying your application across multiple EC2 instances to distribute the load. This can be managed manually or through AWS services like Auto Scaling Groups, which can automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
  
- **Load Balancing**: In addition to scaling out, you'd typically introduce a load balancer (such as AWS ELB - Elastic Load Balancing) to distribute incoming traffic evenly across your fleet of instances, ensuring no single instance is overwhelmed.

### Conclusion

By using Supervisor and Gunicorn, you can improve your Flask application's ability to handle concurrent requests on a single EC2 instance by utilizing multiple worker processes. However, as your application grows and the number of users increases, you will eventually need to implement a scaling strategy that involves deploying additional instances and possibly adopting containerization and orchestration solutions for more dynamic scaling and management.

## EC2 without ECS - How concurrent and autoscaling
  
Without ECS, if you have much traffic, you can use Supervisor with Gunicorn to allow for concurrent flask requests (especially if a request could take a long time, or users are in queue for requests to be available), and you can use together with Docker with Kubernetes to automatically boot up more docker server instances or shutdown docker service instances (especially when the amount of users will overwhelm current server's memory and you'd need to recruit more servers). These are without ECS which will do it automatically (at least with scaling up instances of the server). Both approaches (often you need to use both) can be set up via your SSH terminal. 

#### Using Supervisor with Gunicorn

- **Scenario**: This setup is typically used for Python web applications, where Gunicorn serves as the WSGI HTTP Server to run Python web applications, and Supervisor is used as a process manager to monitor and control Gunicorn processes.
- **Setup**:
    - **Gunicorn**: You can install Gunicorn on your EC2 instance and configure it to run your web application. Gunicorn is effective for handling HTTP requests and serving your web application.
    - **Supervisor**: After installing Supervisor, you configure it to manage your Gunicorn process. Supervisor ensures that Gunicorn is always running and can automatically restart it if it crashes, enhancing the reliability of your deployment.
- **Advantages**: Simple to set up and manage; ideal for smaller-scale applications or when you want direct control over the application's environment without the overhead of containerization.
- **Limitation**: Scaling involves manually managing more EC2 instances and load balancers, or using AWS services like Auto Scaling Groups.

#### Using Docker with Kubernetes

- **Scenario**: For applications that require containerization for development consistency, microservices architecture, or scalability. Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
- **Setup**:
    - **Docker**: Package your application into Docker containers for consistency across different environments and ease of deployment.
    - **Kubernetes**: You can manually install and configure Kubernetes on EC2 instances (though this is complex and manual Kubernetes setup is generally not recommended for production environments due to the operational complexity). Alternatively, you can use Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), which manages Kubernetes for you, but if you're specifically avoiding ECS and other managed services, setting up a self-managed Kubernetes cluster is possible.
- **Advantages**: Highly scalable and efficient for managing containerized applications. Kubernetes offers powerful orchestration capabilities, including self-healing, service discovery, and automatic rollouts/rollbacks.
- **Limitation**: The setup is more complex than using Supervisor with Gunicorn. Requires a good understanding of containerization and Kubernetes concepts.

#### Considerations

- **Complexity vs. Control**: Supervisor with Gunicorn offers a simpler setup with direct control but at the cost of manual scaling and management. Docker with Kubernetes introduces complexity but provides powerful tools for automation, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Scalability Needs**: For high scalability and microservices architecture, Kubernetes is often the better choice. For straightforward web applications where you can manually manage scaling, Supervisor with Gunicorn is sufficient.
- **Operational Overhead**: Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and can add operational complexity. Ensure you have the resources and knowledge to manage it effectively.

### Conclusion

Both approaches are viable and can be set up through your SSH terminal. Your choice should be guided by the specific needs of your application, your team's expertise, and your future scalability requirements. For applications expecting a lot of users and potentially needing to scale dynamically, Kubernetes offers more robust and automated scaling capabilities. For simpler applications or teams with less containerization experience, Supervisor with Gunicorn provides an easier entry point with sufficient scalability through manual intervention.
