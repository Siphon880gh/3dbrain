Three point light system

Edge light
Light behind the subject to create a white line on one side of the body. Likely showing up as a lit/white edge of a side of the face.

Key light
Light to shine the subject so can be seen

Main light
Light likely above the subject to imitate natural sunlight or sunlight going into indoors (so it’s not a pitch black room)



Fill light
Indirect fill light: Light bouncing off of white wall, hitting the subject’s one side
Direct fill light: Towel covering a light source. That light hits the surface softly
Usually you have a fill light one side of the subject

Negative fill
Using a black wall on one side of the subject so the subject has a dark side.


Light travels infinitely but what we can see on the visible spectrum is different.

Intensity will increase the distance of the visible light we can see 

Rect light / softbox size does not affect distance of the visible light. It just affects the area that gets lit. For example, a small softlight onto a wall versus a large softlight onto a wall.
