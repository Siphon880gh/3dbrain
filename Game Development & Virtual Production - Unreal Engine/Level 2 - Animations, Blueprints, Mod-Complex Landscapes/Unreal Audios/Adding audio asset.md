Import the audio File:
Open your Unreal Engine project.
Go to the Content Browser within Unreal Engine.
Right-click in the Content Browser and select 'Import' to open the file dialog.
Navigate to your audio file, select it, and then click 'Open' to import it into your project. Unreal Engine may convert the audio file to a more suitable format for in-engine use.

Test the Sound File:
Play the sound file within the Unreal Engine editor to check if it's working. You can do this by double-clicking the sound asset in the Content Browser.

Re-import the File:
If none of the above steps work, try re-importing the file: Remove the existing asset and import it again. Make sure is not mp3 because unreal 5.3 does not support mp3, even though it won't complain with any errors. It supports wav though.
